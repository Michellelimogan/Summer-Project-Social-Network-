The Social Network Analyzer is a Java program developed as part of a university project.
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the Dapper social network. By examining the networks, we can gain a better understanding of the information flow. 
Dapper offers the same features as other social media platforms, including followers and followings.


This code operates by analyzing the code after receiving a file from the user. 
The output will then provide density, the highest and median follower count, and the most effective information-sharing advertiser.

This code has a total of 5 files:

1. Main Class:

To call the method of each task to print the output of the task.

2. Task One (Count Density):

This file calculates the density of the graph represented by the social network.
The algorithm first reads the file, gathers the data, and then counts the density by dividing all of the edges and followers.
