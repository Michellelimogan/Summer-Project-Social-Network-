The Social Network Analyzer is a Java programme developed as part of a university project.
The primary goal of this project is to analyse the Dapper social network. By examining the networks, we can gain a better understanding of the information flow. 
Dapper offers the same features as other social media platforms, including followers and follows.


This code operates by analysing the code after receiving a file from the user. 
The output will then provide density, the highest and median follower count, and the most effective information-sharing advertiser.
